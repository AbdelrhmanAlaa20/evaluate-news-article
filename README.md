# evalute news article

We will build a web tool that allows users to run Natural Language Processing (NLP) on articles or blogs found on other websites. NLP is the ability of an application to understand the human language, written or oral.

You don't have to worry about NLP, because we will make use of an external api called  to interact with their NLP system. This tool will help us classify the information available in the article, like whether the content is subjective (opinion) or objective (fact-based) and whether it is positive, neutral, or negative in tone.
